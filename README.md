Implementation for the paper on [Linking statistical and ecological theory: Hubbell's unified neutral theory of biodiversity as a hierarchical Dirichlet process](http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.4038) by Keith Harris et al.

This fork is intended to fix a couple of small bugs, improve the efficiency (most notably wrt memory usage), and also parallelise with OpenMP.


The intention is to merge back into the source codebase.

And since it's a work in progress, **IT MAY NOT BUILD, LET ALONE RUN**
